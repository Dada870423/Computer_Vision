## Image processing

### Introduction
In task 1, there are many similar images pairs. Our goal is using filter to get the useful data, and blend two images to a reasonable image. 
In task 2, we need to construct Gaussian and Laplacian 5-layer image pyramids. This work help us  observe the residual between two pictures within different resolutions. 
In task 3, we have some Prokudin-Gorskii photo. These photos are took by special method and records negative values of R, G, B respectively. The goal is to recover the original image by aligning 
the red channel and the green channel to the blue channel. 

### Implementation
- please refer HW2 report.pdf to get more details.

### Result
- Task 1
