## Image classifier

### Introduction
In this homework, we try to build a classifier to categorize images into one of 15 scene types. We tried different methods from task 1 to task 3 to get better results. 
In task 1, we implemented tiny images representation, then 
use brute force method to find k-nearest neighbor and decide the type of test image. 
In task 2, we try the combination of bag of SIFT representation and nearest neighbor classifier, the accuracy of classification rise to about 50%. 
In task 3, nearest neighbor classifier is replaced with  linear SVM classifier.
