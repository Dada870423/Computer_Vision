## Camera calibration

### Introduction
Camera calibration is the process of estimating the parameters of a camera that produced images or video. By using these parameters, we can correct distortion, measure the size of an object in world 
units, or determine the location of the camera in the scene. We use this technology in applications such as machine vision (for detecting and measuring objects) or navigation systems, and 3-D scene 
reconstruction.

### Implementation
- please refer HW1 report.pdf to get detail
- how to run this code
```bash=
python camera_calibration.py
```

### Result
We run our code with two data set. One is comprised of 10 pictures from TA, named as 0000.png~0009.jpg. The other has 10 pictures took by our memberâ€™s smartphone, named as img0.jpg-
img9.jpg.
